# CoffeePotHack
A coffee pot, an arduino d1 mini with a esp8266 wireless card, and some C/C# code = wireless coffee machine

This code will allow you to convert your non-wireless coffee pot into a wireless coffee machine.  
Start your coffee brew when ever your phone alarm goes off, when you are 5 minutes away from home, or even set it up to any other device
